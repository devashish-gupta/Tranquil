* **Doppler Simulation Unit**: Tranquil is equipped with a powerful Doppler Effect simulation unit, which can be used to create not only crystalline, glittery reverb tails but also anharmonic Zen sounds.

* **Submerge and Sheen**: The Submerge knob does exactly what it says, it makes the reverb tails sound as if they're submerged in the depths of the ocean. It's more than just an EQ. The Sheen knob makes the reverb tails brighter and cleaner.
